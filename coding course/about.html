        <h1><b>Pinky Dlamini - Modesta</b></h1>
        <p>Durban based ladies-wear designer, Pinky Dlamini is the owner and creative director of brand Modesta which is known for its elegant, timeless and contemporary style that perfectly suits today’s busy women.

            Dlamini was inspired to join the fashion industry when she became fascinated with the process of taking an idea and bringing it to life in the form of sketch before translating it into a completed garment through the use of the fabric, trimmings and technical skill.
            
            She obtained a National Diploma in Fashion obtained from Durban University of Technology (DUT). As her designs continue to mature, she remains inspired by South Africa’s diverse cultures and traditions, different tribes, lifestyles and everyday life.
            She is captivated by layers of fabrics, African and tribal prints, bead work and embellishments which help provide the colourful, afrocentric palette that is evident in.
